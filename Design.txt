Design Decisions
- I added a field to store the board in Game. I used PickleProperty because it allowed
me to store a Python List in the datastore which seemed like the simplest way
to record the state of the board.
- I also added next_move, user_x, user_o, and winner (all KeyProperty) to the Game
model to keep track of which User was either 'X' or 'O' and who's move it was.
- I used a 'game_over' flag as well to mark completed games.
- I modified the Score model to record result of the game.
The result field can contain three values: 'user_x', 'user_o' and 'tie'.
Finished game will either have value in winner or tie properties.
- Since I keep games even when they finish in a tie, which makes it quite
hard to keep result in a BooleanField, I decided to store them in a
StringField in Score model and only give 3 possible
values there: 'user_x', 'user_o', 'tie'.
- Most games in tic-tac-toe finish in a tie, so I decided to use
not_lose_percentage property mostly, to rank players
- Checking for winner is hardcoded for 3x3 board to make it easier.
