##Game Description:
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple two player game. Game instructions are available
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe). Games can also be created
to use board with size up to 100x100.

The board is represented as a 1-D list of squares with indexes as follows:  
[0, 1, 2  
 3, 4, 5  
 6, 7, 8]

Indexes on bigger boards will follow the pattern. For example below is 5x5 board:  

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4  
 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
 10, 11, 12, 13, 14  
 15, 16, 17, 18, 19  
 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]


##Game example:
In the example we have following situation on the board:  
| X | O | X  
| O | X |  
| O |     |

Next move is on user_x which let's say name is Mouse. He can make move to
positions with following indexes: 5, 7, 8. By making his move on index 8 he
will win the game. So calling make_move endpoint with user_name Mouse and
move 8 will result in winning him the game.
